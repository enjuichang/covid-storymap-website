# COVID Story Map Visualization Website

This repository hosts the website for my Capstone Project for Minerva University. This includes the images, HTML, CSS, and Javascript code.

For this project, I mainly worked on Bootstrap Studio and did not handle the HTML code directly except for a few custom components of the website. To learn more about the data analysis, please checkout my other repository: [PSD-lockdown](https://github.com/enjuichang/PSD-lockdown).
