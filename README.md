# COVID Story Map Visualization Website

This repository hosts the website for my Capstone Project for Minerva University. This includes the images, HTML, CSS, and Javascript code.


My Capstone Project is about using various data to record the change in mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan from a story map format. The main data includes seismic noise mobility, transit statistics, big tech mobility index and COVID cases. The visualization was mainly done in Tableau with the help of some CSS magic.


For this project, I mainly worked on Bootstrap Studio and did not handle the HTML code directly except for a few custom components of the website. To learn more about the data analysis, please checkout my other repository: [PSD-lockdown](https://github.com/enjuichang/PSD-lockdown).
